# Week1_Risc-v_soc_Tapeout_program

Welcome to **Week 1** of the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**!  This repository hosts the initial phase of a groundbreaking initiative by the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IITGN) and VLSI System Design (VSD), aimed at transforming India's semiconductor landscape. This program is a 20-week journey from RTL design to silicon tapeout, empowering participants to contribute to India's technological sovereignty.

## Overview
**From Silicon to Sovereignty**: This program aligns with Indiaâ€™s vision of "One Tapeout Per Student" and semiconductor self-reliance. It bridges the gap between academia and industry through hands-on learning, utilizing industry-grade tools and methodologies to create job-ready VLSI professionals.

### Why This Matters?
- Supports Indiaâ€™s national goal of semiconductor independence.
- Offers end-to-end chip design expertise, from RTL to fabrication.
- Provides access to premium workshops by VSD, free for deserving candidates.

### Who Should Join?
- Engineering students and professionals in VLSI, electronics, or computer science.
- Enthusiasts eager to shape Indiaâ€™s semiconductor future.

## 1. About This Program
This initiative is more than a training courseâ€”itâ€™s a national mission. Participants will:
- Master Verilog RTL design, simulation, and synthesis.
- Utilize tools like Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, and Yosys with the Sky130 PDK.
- Explore key concepts: testbenches, timing libraries, optimization techniques, and more.
- Gain hands-on experience with weekly labs leading to a silicon tapeout.

---

## 2. Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of digital logic (gates, flip-flops, multiplexers).
- Familiarity with Linux command-line operations.
- A Linux environment (or WSL on Windows/macOS).
- Installed tools: `git`, `iverilog`, `gtkwave`, `yosys`, and a text editor (e.g., `gedit`).

**Installation Commands**:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git iverilog gtkwave yosys gedit
```

## 3. Program Structure
The program is organized into weeks, each with a dedicated folder and `README.md` file. Week 1 includes:

- [Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis](#day-1-introduction-to-verilog-rtl-design--synthesis)
- [Day 2: Timing Libraries, Synthesis Strategies, and Flip-Flop Coding](#day-2-timing-libraries-synthesis-strategies-and-flip-flop-coding)
- [Day 3: Combinational and Sequential Optimization](#day-3-combinational-and-sequential-optimization)
- [Day 4: Gate-Level Simulation and Blocking vs. Non-Blocking](#day-4-gate-level-simulation-and-blocking-vs-non-blocking)
- [Day 5: Synthesis Optimization & Coding Styles](#day-5-synthesis-optimization--coding-styles)

Each dayâ€™s folder contains:
- Detailed explanations of concepts.
- Step-by-step labs with Verilog code and screenshots (e.g., `lab7.png`).
- Best practices for RTL design and synthesis.

Explore the folders:
- [Day 1](Week1/Day1)
- [Day 2](Week1/Day2)
- [Day 3](Week1/Day3)
- [Day 4](Week1/Day4)
- [Day 5](Week1/Day5)
